Project about community (dis)similarity in Swedish green infrastructures

Comparison of bumblebee, butterfly and plant communities in different habitat types depending on the presence of green infrastructures (powerlines, roads) and on the amount of grassland in the surrounding landscape. 

## Preliminary results

### Species diversity

Overall, there were differences in species diversity between taxa, both in terms of raw species richness (*F*<sub>2,391</sub> = 303.83, *P* < 0.001) and using the Shannon index of diversity (*F*<sub>2,391</sub> = 341.09, *P* < 0.001) (Fig. 1).

Specifically, the sampling plots had a higher species diversity of plants (Mean species richness per transect = 16.7, Mean Shannon index per transect = 2.62) than butterflies (Mean species richness per transect = 8.65, Mean Shannon index per transect = 1.64), and a higher species diversity of butterflies than bumblebees (Mean species richness per transect = 4.22, Mean Shannon index per transect = 1.09).

There were differences in species diversity (expressed as Shannon index) between the different habitat types for both plants (*F*<sub>4,127</sub>~ = 11.79, *P* < 0.001) and butterflies (*F*<sub>4,128</sub> = 6.45, *P* < 0.001) but not for bumblebees (*F*<sub>4,128</sub> = 2.01, *P* = 0.097).

### Community composition


Below is a plot of a Non-metric multidimensional scaling analysis (NMDS) showing the overlap / differences in community composition between different habitats:

Pairwise distances show that between-fields habitats have the most unique species composition while pasture and small road habitats are consistently very similar.

### Beta diversity

Beta-diversity appears consistently lower in powerline habitats and higher in road habitats and pastures, while beta-diversity is at an intermediate level in between-fields habitats (field margins).

Partitioning of beta-diversity reveals that patterns of beta-diversity are mostly driven by species turnover between habitat types.
