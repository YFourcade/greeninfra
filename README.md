Project about community (dis)similarity in Swedish green infrastructures

Comparison of bumblebee, butterfly and plant communities in different habitat types depending on the presence of green infrastructures (powerlines, roads) and on the amount of grassland in the surrounding landscape. 

## Preliminary results

Below is a plot of a Non-metric multidimensional scaling analysis (NMDS) showing differences in bumblebee community composition between different habitats:

In accordance with the visual inspection of the NMDS, beta-diversity appears clearly lower in powerline habitats and higher in road habitats and pastures, while beta-diversity was at an intermediate level in between-fields habitats.

Partitionning of beta-diversity reveals that both road habitats (small and big roads) were characterised by a larger nestedness of communities, i.e. community composition in species-poor sites is a subset of the species found in the species-rich sites.
